# 1 Introduction

In Lab 2 we are tasked with the use of the application JUnit in order to execute automated unit testing. We will delve deeper into scripted testing and writing various test cases for an application. We will then test our cases on various versions of the application, and record the results. The application we will be testing is called JFreeChart, an open-source framework that uses Java for creating and displaying many different types of charts. This application is integrated into many other systems as an efficient method to add charting functionality to other programs. We will also be utilizing black-box test case design methodologies, such as equivalence classes and boundary value analysis.

The goal of this assignment is to familiarize ourselves with the basics of automated unit testing, focusing on testing based on individual unit requirements, and introducing ourselves to implementing black-box test design methods.


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

For the lab we had to implement black box testing as many of the methods we needed to test required the use of external objects. We are going to be  utilizing equivalence class testing (p using two trivial partitions, where there were two subsets, one of which included the expected inputs and the other subset that included illegal inputs. Since we were testing methods that had to take in a number of arguments, separating the tests into invalid and valid inputs was a good way to start out testing. Since a lot of the functions also had constraints on the values we were allowed to input in as arguments, using equivalence class testing was beneficial as we were able to see if only valid inputs would work with the intended method. Once we created tests for class testing in equivalence classes, we focused on using boundary value testing. Since many of the methods allowed a range of values that could be specified as arguments, we tested for values that would be at the boundary of these limits, and values that would fall outside the boundary to ensure the test behaves as expected. This testing approach helped us to categorize the inputs that would be placed into certain methods, and ensured we didn’t duplicate tests and include values that would fall under the same category. After analyzing each of the methods, and using equivalence class testing and boundary class testing we were able to figure out tests that covered the functionality for most of these methods.


For many of these tests we needed to use mocking. Specifically for the DataUtilities class, it took in objects of type KeyedValues and Values2D. Since we do not have any knowledge of how these objects are constructed or how they behave, we can use mocking. Mocking imitates those objects so that we don’t have to worry about the specifications of that object. The benefits of mocking that we found were that it greatly simplified testing. We didn’t have to worry about the constructions of the KeyedValues and Values2D objects and we were able to focus on testing the methods themselves rather than focusing on the objects that we need to input in. A drawback to mocking however is that because we are not able to create the other objects, we cannot fully access the properties of that object. For example for the Values2D object, which is a 2x2 matrix, since we couldn’t make that object we were not working with a 2 dimensional matrix, rather we had to substitute in some value at specific positions of the mocking object. Not having the fully populated matrix was limiting in some of the testing that can be done with it. Along with this, mocking increases the amount of code and affects the readability.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We tasked everyone in the group to first go through the documentation for the DataUtilities and Range classes, and to review the slides presented in class to ensure everyone had the same base level understanding. Once everyone was familiar with the material, we split the group into pairs, where Sahil and Harshal worked on the test cases for the DataUtilities class, and Siwon and Abhiraam worked on the test cases for the Range class. We made sure to follow the unit test strategy that we described above to test each method comprehensively. Once the pairs were done with their testing, the group went through each of the test cases together to review the tests. Suggestions were also made while the test cases were presented if any tests were missing or if there were errors with the tests.


# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Similar to last time, we faced difficulty understanding the assignment instructions. This led to us falling behind as we misinterpreted the instructions. This led to a late start on the assignment, and some disorganization with assigning roles, as all of us were struggling to understand the assignment. Eventually, we ended up figuring out what we were supposed to do and got started, but it was much later than we would have wanted. In the future, we will ask for help from a TA to understand the assignment, as well as start the assignment earlier. This will make it so that we do not waste time trying to interpret the instructions, and can finish earlier without a time crunch.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The instructions were difficult to interpret and understand. A lot of time was wasted trying to understand the assignment. Additionally, it would be preferred to have assignment lab demo times, as some groups show up and leave after 5 minutes, and other groups have to wait a whole two hours for a TA to present.
